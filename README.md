## Overview

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer provides visualizations of common sorting algorithms, along with complexity tables, code implementations, and descriptions of each one's advantages and disadvantages. This program is intended to be used as an educational tool and currently supports 5 algorithms, but more may be added in the future. So far, the available algorithms are quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
