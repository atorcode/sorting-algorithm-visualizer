    "description": "<p>Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input list into <em>n</em> sublists of size one, and then repeatedly merging these with their neighbors to produce new sorted sublists <em>log n</em> times, until there is only one sublist remaining, i.e., the entire sorted list. It is typically implemented recursively, and it uses the divide-and-conquer strategy of breaking down the problem into similar, smaller sized subproblems, solving those, and composing their solutions to solve the larger problem.</p><p>Merge sort is a popular choice because it performs much more efficiently than quadratic sorting algorithms for large datasets. For smaller datasets, simpler algorithms perform better, as the overhead of recursively dividing the input and merging isn't worth it. It also has advantages over quick sort in that it is stable, so the relative order of elements with equal keys stays unchanged, and it generally performs fewer comparisons. One drawback of merge sort when compared to quick sort is its higher space requirement. However, in the case of linked lists, merge sort actually has a better space complexity than quick sort, and therefore it is regarded as the best algorithm for these types of inputs. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Bubble sort, named after the way that the largest elements bubble up to the top of the list first, is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping their values if needed. This process is continued until a pass is made through the list in which no swaps occurred, signalling that everything is sorted.</p><p>Bubble sort's use is primarily as an educational tool. Its main advantages are as follows. It is in-place, meaning that only constant additional memory is needed. It is adaptive, so the time it takes to run this algorithm is greatly reduced on mostly sorted inputs. And it is stable, so that the relative ordering of elements with equal keys is maintained. However, this algorithm performs more poorly than the similar insertion sort, or even selection sort for that matter. </p><p>Sometimes, the terms \"rabbits\" and \"turtles\" are used to refer to the way certain elements behave within the context of bubble sort. Rabbits are the elements that want to move toward the end of the list, and they can do this very quickly because the algorithm goes from left to right. Turtles are the smaller elements that want to move toward the beginning of the list, but they cannot move faster than one step to the left per pass. The slow speed of turtles presents a bottleneck on the speed of bubble sort as a whole, so there are variations like cocktail sort and comb sort which attempt to minimize this imbalance by making turtles faster.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Selection sort is a simple in-place sorting algorithm which divides the input array into a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray.
